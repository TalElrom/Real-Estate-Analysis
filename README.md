# Real-Estate-Analysis
Real Estate Analysis is a machine learning project in which we classify whether a residential property is sold above or below its appraised value. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model comparison, and feature ablation to analyze the impact of property characteristics, location, and transaction timing.

The repository contains separate folders for the dataset, analysis notebooks, and generated figures.
